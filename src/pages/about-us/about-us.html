  <P class="p" style="line-height: 25.2px;letter-spacing: 1.2px;">'BloodFinder' is the first product resulted out of the community
    welfare initiative called 'People Project' from Aditya Innovations. Universally, 
    'Blood' is recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves 
    umerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. Once in 
    every 2- seconds, someone, somewhere is desperately in need of blood. More than 
    29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. The need for 
    blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of
     Red Blood Cells are needed. Each year, we could
      meet only up to 1% (approx) of our nationâ€™s 
   demand for blood transfusion.</P>
